## Integrating GraphQL with ExpressJS

GraphQL is a plugin to an otherwise standard Express application which handles gql queries. The code app is free to do its standard REST endpoints or other types of server-things as and when required.

### Basic dependencies requires

- **express-graphql** `deprecated`: middleware layer for express to use graphql lib.
- **graphql**: The JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL.
